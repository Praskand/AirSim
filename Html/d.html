    <br>______________________________________________________<br>For the petitioner:
    <br>Mr. Sanjeev Bhushan, Senior<br>Advocate, with Mr. Rakesh Kumar
    <br>and Mr. Sohail Khan, Advocates.<br>For the respondents:<br><br>Ms. Avni Kochhar, Deputy Advocate
    <br>General.<br><br>Satyen Vaidya, Judge<br>Petitioner<br><br>has<br><br>prayed<br><br>for<br><br>following<br><br>substantive reliefs:<br>i)<br><br>That appropriate writ, order or direction may<br>very kindly be issued and the impugned<br>orders Annexures P-1 dated 1st November,<br>2019 and P-2 dated 8th January, 2020 may<br>very kindly be quashed and set-aside, in the<br>interest of law and justice.<br><br>ii)<br><br>That appropriate writ, order or direction may<br>very<br><br>1<br><br>kindly<br><br>be<br><br>issued<br><br>Whether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the judgment?<br><br>directing<br><br>the<br><br>2<br><br>respondents to re-instate the petitioner in<br>service with all consequential benefits of<br>pay, arrears, seniority etc. alongwith the<br>interest @ 9% per annum, in the interest of<br>law and justice.<br>iii)<br><br>That appropriate writ, order or direction may<br>very<br><br>kindly<br><br>respondents<br><br>be<br>to<br><br>issued<br><br>directing<br><br>pay full salary to<br><br>the<br>the<br><br>petitioner for the suspension period by<br>granting the arrears alongwith interest @ 9%<br>per annum.<br>2.<br><br>Petitioner, while serving as Subject Matter<br><br>Specialist in the Department of Agriculture, Himachal<br>Pradesh, was ordered to be transferred to Kaza in Lahaul &amp;<br>Spiti District vide office order dated 30.08.2018. The<br>petitioner did not join at Kaza till 07.02.2019. The defiance<br>on part of the petitioner to obey the administrative orders<br>was viewed seriously by the disciplinary authority and was<br>considered as a misconduct under Rule 3 of the CCS<br>(Conduct) Rules, 1964. In the first instance, show cause<br>notice was served upon the petitioner. Having remained<br>dis-satisfied with the cause shown by petitioner, a charge<br>memo was served upon him. Inquiry under Rule 14 of the<br>CCS (CCA) Rules was conducted. The Inquiry Officer found<br><br>3<br><br>the charges proved against the petitioner. The disciplinary<br>authority concurred with the inquiry report and imposed<br>the major penalty of removal from service.<br>3.<br><br>The petitioner has approached this Court with a<br><br>grievance that he could not join at Kaza till 07.02.2019 on<br>account of his compelling circumstances. It has been<br>submitted in the alternative that the misconduct alleged<br>against the petitioner was not of such magnitude which<br>called for infliction of major penalty. The petitioner has also<br>challenged the penalty imposed against him to be strikingly<br>disproportionate to his alleged misconduct.<br>4.<br><br>As per petitioner, initially he had sought legal<br><br>remedies against the order of his transfer to Kaza by<br>approaching the erstwhile State Administrative Tribunal<br>(for short “Tribunal”). He had been protected by the orders<br>of the Tribunal. The reason to challenge the transfer order<br>as<br><br>per<br><br>petitioner<br><br>was<br><br>his<br><br>individual<br><br>hardship.<br><br>The<br><br>petitioner alleged his inability to serve at Kaza on account<br>of his family circumstances viz., the wife of petitioner was<br>serving at GSSS, Jawalamukhi and as per the policy of the<br>Government he was entitled to be posted at or near the<br><br>4<br><br>station where his spouse was posted; his parents were old<br>and ailing and lastly the education of his children would<br>have suffered. Petitioner further contended that he had<br>every right to avail legal remedies and his absence from<br>duties could not be termed as misconduct.<br>5.<br><br>The submissions of the respondents on the other<br><br>hand are that the petitioner had willfully disobeyed the<br>administrative<br><br>orders<br><br>which<br><br>amounted<br><br>to<br><br>serious<br><br>misconduct. As per respondents, the petitioner made every<br>effort<br><br>to<br><br>stall<br><br>his<br><br>transfer<br><br>to<br><br>Kaza<br><br>by<br><br>repeatedly<br><br>approaching the Tribunal. Having failed to get any relief<br>from<br><br>the<br><br>Tribunal,<br><br>he<br><br>had<br><br>further<br><br>unsuccessfully<br><br>approached this Court and Hon’ble Supreme Court also. In<br>this background, it is alleged that the petitioner had no<br>lawful reason to disobey the orders of his transfer. The<br>respondents have also highlighted the subsequent conduct<br>of petitioner which suggests that petitioner joined at Kaza<br>on 07.02.2019 and on the very next day i.e. 08.02.2019 he<br>proceeded on leave and left the station without informing<br>his superior/supervisory officer and thereafter remained<br>absent<br><br>till<br><br>20.03.2019.<br><br>The<br><br>conduct<br><br>of<br><br>disciplinary<br><br>5<br><br>proceedings and imposition of penalty has been sought to<br>be justified on the ground that the same was warranted in<br>the facts and circumstances of the case for the reasons<br>firstly that the petitioner had grossly misconducted himself<br>by<br><br>disobeying<br><br>the<br><br>lawful<br><br>administrative<br><br>orders<br><br>and<br><br>secondly to avoid indiscipline in the service, the action was<br>necessitated.<br>6.<br><br>I have heard learned counsel for the parties and<br><br>have also gone through the records of the case carefully.<br>7.<br><br>It is not in dispute that the petitioner challenged<br><br>transfer order dated 30.08.2018 before the Tribunal by way<br>of O.A. No. 5403 of 2018. The Tribunal vide order dated<br>10.09.2018 disposed of the O.A. of petitioner with liberty to<br>make a representation to the competent authority and<br>direction to the competent authority to decide the same.<br>The respondents were also directed not to compel the<br>petitioner to join at Kaza till the decision on his<br>representation. As a sequel, petitioner made representation<br>on<br><br>15.09.2018<br><br>which<br><br>was<br><br>rejected<br><br>on<br><br>28.09.2018.<br><br>Thereafter, the petitioner again approached the Tribunal<br>with O.A. No.6013 of 2018 assailing the rejection order<br><br>6<br><br>dated 28.09.2018, which was again disposed of with<br>direction to decide the representation of petitioner afresh.<br>The competent authority again rejected the case of<br>petitioner vide office order dated 17.10.2018. The petitioner<br>filed another O.A. before the Tribunal and again failed to<br>secure any relief. The petitioner then approached this<br>Court by way of CWP No.2718 of 2018, which was decided<br>on 15.11.2018. Again, no relief was granted to the<br>petitioner save and except liberty to approach the employer<br>with his grievances. The petitioner then approached<br>Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of Special Leave to Appeal<br>(C) No.2164 of 2019 against order dated 15.11.2018 passed<br>by this Court. The Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 2164 of<br>2019 was dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide<br>order dated 28.01.2019 in the following terms:<br>“We are not inclined to interfere with the<br>impugned order passed by the High Court. The<br>Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed.<br>Let the petitioner join duty at the place of<br>posting within ten days from today and compliance<br>be reported to this Court immediately after ten days.”<br><br>7<br><br>8.<br><br>It is thereafter that the petitioner joined at Kaza<br><br>for one day on 07.02.2019. Thus, there is no denying the<br>fact that the petitioner failed to join and serve at Kaza till<br>07.02.2019 despite order of his transfer having been issued<br>on 30.08.2018.<br>9.<br><br>Though, the petitioner has taken a plea that he<br><br>had protection of the orders passed by the Tribunal, but<br>except for the direction dated 10.9.2018 to the respondents<br>not to compel the petitioner to join at Kaza till the decision<br>on the representation of the petitioner, no other order of<br>protection has been placed on record. It is also not in<br>dispute that the protection so granted to the petitioner by<br>the Tribunal on 10.09.2018 had also come to an end on<br>30.09.2018 with the rejection of his representation.<br>10.<br><br>The petitioner had been served with a show<br><br>cause notice on 22.11.2018. He had submitted his reply on<br>04.12.2018, which was not found satisfactory. Petitioner<br>was ordered to be suspended w.e.f. 07.12.2018 and his<br>headquarter was fixed at Kaza. Still the petitioner did not<br>join at Kaza.<br><br>8<br><br>11.<br><br>The<br><br>Article<br><br>of<br><br>Charge<br><br>framed<br><br>against<br><br>the<br><br>petitioner was as under:<br>“That the said Sh. Raxpal Singh, while working<br>as<br><br>SMS(Agriculture,)<br><br>Development<br><br>Block,<br><br>Dehra,<br><br>District Kangra has failed to maintain discipline,<br>devotion to duty, disobeyed the orders of the superior<br>authorities and did the things which are unbecoming<br>on the part of a Government servant. The said officer<br>failed to join the duties at Kaza as APO even after<br>lapse of more than 4 months’ time for which was<br>directed thrice. Lastly the said officer was placed<br>under suspension on 7.12.2018 with headquarter in<br>the O/o A.D.C. Kaza.<br>Therefore, Sh. Rax Paul Singh, SMS, is charged<br>for misconduct and disobedience of the orders of the<br>superior authorities in the manner and spirit of Rule-3<br>of Central Civil Services (Conduct Rules, 1964).”<br><br>12.<br><br>After holding the inquiry, the Inquiry Officer had<br><br>concluded as under:<br>“From inquiry conducted, it is revealed that Sh.<br>Raxpal Singh, SMS who have been transferred from<br>Development Block, Dehra to Kaza as APO vice Sh.<br>Abhay Singh, APO to SMS Dehra, keeping in the view<br>ill health of spouse of Sh. Abhay Singh (on<br>administrative grounds). The transferred officer Sh.<br>Rax Pal Singh, SMS, Dehra did not join his duties at<br>new place of posting as APO at Kaza and filed series<br>of petitions before Hon’ble HPAT, Hon’ble Court and<br><br>9<br><br>Apex Court and try to seek liberty/relief in place of<br>posting other than APO Kaza. During the course of<br>judgment none of the Court has provided him any<br>relief except extension in joining time awarded by<br>State Authority time to time in all cases, the said<br>officer has tried to justify the liberties sought and<br>had not act upon the orders issued by superior<br>authorities time and again, in the manner and spirit<br>of rule-3 of Central Civil Service(Conduct) Rules,<br>1964.<br>Hence, the charges levelled against Sh. Raxpal<br>Singh, SMS, regarding misconduct and disobedience<br>of the order of the superior authorities are hereby<br>justified, however, it is worth mentioning here that<br>the charged officer had no intention to flout the<br>orders of competent authorities but to get relief under<br>government framed couple case transfer policy and<br>to seek justice he approached Hon’ble Tribunal time<br>and again and Hon’ble High Court and Apex Court in<br>succession and when his plea was turned down by<br>the Apex Court, the charged officer immediately<br>joined at Kaza within time limit granted by Apex<br>Court.”<br><br>13.<br><br>The jurisdiction of Constitutional courts in<br><br>the matters involving disciplinary proceedings are well<br>defined. In Deputy General Manager (Appellate<br>Authority) and others vs. Ajai Kumar Srivastava<br><br>10<br><br>(2021) 2 SCC 612, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has<br>held as under:<br>“24. It is thus settled that the power of judicial<br>review, of the Constitutional Courts, is an evaluation<br>of the decision making process and not the merits of<br>the decision itself. It is to ensure fairness in treatment<br>and not to ensure fairness of conclusion. The<br>Court/Tribunal may interfere in the proceedings held<br>against the delinquent if it is, in any manner,<br>inconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in<br>violation of the statutory rules prescribing the mode of<br>enquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by<br>the disciplinary authority is based on no evidence. If<br>the conclusion or finding be such as no reasonable<br>person would have ever reached or where the<br>conclusions<br><br>upon<br><br>consideration<br><br>of<br><br>the<br><br>evidence<br><br>reached by the disciplinary authority are perverse or<br>suffer from patent error on the face of record or based<br>on no evidence at all, a writ of certiorari could be<br>issued. To sum up, the scope of judicial review cannot<br>be extended to the examination of correctness or<br>reasonableness of a decision of authority as a matter<br>of fact.<br>25. When the disciplinary enquiry is conducted for<br>the alleged misconduct against the public servant, the<br>Court is to examine and determine:<br><br>11<br><br>14.<br><br>(i)<br><br>whether the enquiry was held by the competent<br>authority;<br><br>(ii)<br><br>whether rules of natural justice are complied<br>with;<br><br>(iii)<br><br>whether the findings or conclusions are based<br>on some evidence and authority has power and<br>jurisdiction to reach finding of fact or<br>conclusion.”<br><br>The petitioner has not been able to justify his<br><br>allegations with respect to violation of principles of<br>natural justice or the findings recorded against him in<br>the disciplinary proceedings to be perverse. It is clearly<br>evident from the above noticed facts that the petitioner had<br>no justification in not complying with the administrative<br>order of his transfer except his self-assumed notions. The<br>transfer being an incidence of service, petitioner was bound<br>to obey the transfer order. He had failed to secure any<br>protection from the Courts/Tribunal except to the limited<br>extent as noticed above. Even if the petitioner had right to<br>avail legal remedies, he could have joined under protest<br>reserving his rights. To the contrary, petitioner kept<br>disobeying the administrative orders. In this background,<br>the report of Inquiry Officer and the findings recorded by<br><br>12<br><br>Disciplinary or Appellate Authorities cannot be said to be<br>perverse so as to warrant any interference by this Court.<br><br>15.<br>that<br><br>As regards the contention of the petitioner<br>the<br><br>punishment<br><br>inflicted<br><br>upon<br><br>him<br><br>was<br><br>disproportionate to his alleged misconduct, again I am<br>not persuaded keeping in view the fact that petitioner<br>had shown the audacity to disobey and defy the<br>administrative orders of his superiors without any<br>lawful justification. Gross indiscipline by a government<br>servant, if left unpunished, will potentially have serious<br>consequences and hence cannot be brushed aside<br>lightly.<br>16.<br><br>The powers of this court to go into the<br><br>question of proportionality of punishment is also well<br>circumscribed. In Union of India and others vs.<br>Constable Sunil Kumar (2023) 3 SCC 622, the<br>Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:<br>“11. Even otherwise, the Division Bench of the High<br>Court has materially erred in interfering with the<br>order of penalty of dismissal passed on proved<br><br>13<br><br>charges<br><br>and<br><br>misconduct<br><br>of<br><br>indiscipline<br><br>and<br><br>insubordination and giving threats to the superior of<br>dire consequences on the ground that the same is<br>disproportionate to the gravity of the wrong. In the<br>case of CRPF vs. Surinder Kumar (2011) 10 SCC 244,<br>while considering the power of judicial review of the<br>High Court in interfering with the punishment of<br>dismissal, it is observed and held by this Court after<br>considering the earlier decision in the case of Union of<br>India Vs. R.K. Sharma; (2001) 9 SCC 592 that in<br>exercise of powers of judicial review interfering with<br>the punishment of dismissal on the ground that it was<br>disproportionate, the punishment should not be<br>merely disproportionate but should be strikingly<br>disproportionate. As observed and held that only in<br>an extreme case, where on the face of it there is<br>perversity or irrationality, there can be judicial review<br>under Articles 226 or 227 or under Article 32 of the<br>Constitution.”<br><br>17.<br><br>In the background facts as noticed above, I<br><br>do not find the punishment of removal from service to<br>be strikingly or shockingly disproportionate to the<br>charge of misconduct proved against petitioner.<br>18.<br><br>Another contention of the petitioner that the<br><br>order passed in appeal is by a subordinate authority to<br>the disciplinary authority also deserves rejection as the<br><br>14<br><br>appeal has been decided by the Appellate Authority<br>and the order has been signed under delegated<br>authority, which is permissible in law.<br>19.<br><br>In view of above discussion, there is no merit in<br><br>the petition and the same is dismissed.<br>20.<br><br>The<br><br>petition<br><br>as<br><br>also<br><br>the<br><br>miscellaneous<br><br>application(s), if any, stand disposed of.<br>14th June, 2024<br>(GR)<br><br>(Satyen Vaidya)<br>Judge<br><br>
